This project came about from reading about Parkinson's disease sufferers who have found some relief using a Beech Band. 
Carl Beech a PD sufferer who suffers from poor control of his speach, realised it improved dramatiacally if he tapped with his finger
on the back of his other hand. He then went on to design, and crowdfund, a device to replicate this automatically.
This afternoon 14:00 26/03/2025 I thought that I could possibly replicate this with an App on my Samsung Watch 5.
After discussing this with Grok3 we had a working model about an hour later. It took me longer to sort out GitHub local and remote 
Repositories for my upstairs and downstairs Windows 10 PCs! (i messeed them up before teatimee!)
